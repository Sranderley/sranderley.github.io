		<span class="demo-card-text">This site serves as a platform for showcasing some AngularJS modules. The development of these modules is ongoing and new demos will be posted regularly, so be sure to check back from time to time!</span>
		<h3 class="demo-card-heading">Navigating the Site</h3>
		<span class="demo-card-text">On the left, there is a collapsed sidenav. Clicking on the hamburger menu at the top expands the nav, and exposes a list of AngularJS modules. Clicking on a module opens up a list of the components that the module contains, and selecting a module populates the view with examples. Clicking the Home icon in the upper right corner of the site brings you back to this welcome page.</span>
		<h3 class="demo-card-heading">Content Cards</h3>
		<span class="demo-card-text">Any content which populates the view is presented on a Content Card (including these notes!). The banner of the Content Card contains a title on the left and two buttons on the right â€” a Github link, and a WordPress link. On this welcome card, the Github button will take you to my Github page where you can view all of my public repos. The WordPress button will take you to the main page of my WordPress site. When viewing the demo page for a component of a module, however, the WordPress button will take you to an article written about the design and use of that component, and the Github button will take you to the README.md for that repository that hosts that module.</span><br><br>
		<span class="demo-card-text">Also worth noting is that each component's Content Card is broken into Shelves. Every Shelf has a title in the upper left and a &lt;/&gt; code-viewer button in the upper right. Clicking on the code-viewer button exposes the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS used to build the examples.</span><br><br>
		<h3 class="demo-card-heading">More Info</h3>
		<span class="demo-card-text">This page is a single page application built in AngularJS, hosted with Github Pages. It uses nothing more than AngularJS and its ngAria accessability module, HTML, CSS, and the modules that are being showcased.</span><br><br>
		<span class="demo-card-text">If you have any questions for me, please follow the WordPress link to find my contact information.</span><br><br>
		<span class="demo-card-text">Thanks for checking out the demo page!</span><br>
